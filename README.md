# RRAccountDebloater
Debloat your Rec Room account.

This repository will be updated with various scripts that can be used to debloat your Rec Room account.

All scripts will be ran in your browser's console while logged in on [RecNet](https://rec.net).

It's said that account bloat diminishes the game's or RecNet's performance. Whether or not that is true, getting rid of unnecessary junk is always nice.

## Friend purging
Found [here](https://github.com/Jegarde/RRAccountDebloater/blob/main/friend_purge.js).
This script purges all your friends BUT keeps the favorited ones. Get rid of all your unimportant friends.
