# RRAccountDebloater
Debloat your Rec Room account.

This repository will be updated with various scripts that can be used to debloat your Rec Room account.

It's said that account bloat diminishes the game's or RecNet's performance. Whether or not that is true, getting rid of unnecessary junk is always nice.

## Usage
All scripts are to be ran in your browser's console while logged in on [RecNet](https://rec.net). 

## Scripts
